## Install

Install smbus2 python module for i2c communication 
- `pip install smbus2`

Clone this repo to src directory of catkin workspace
- `cd ~/catkin_ws/src`
- `git clone https://github.com/rasheeddo/jmoab-ros.git`

Checking that your computer (Jetson or Pi) could detect this device
- `i2cdetect -y -r 1` then you should see a device address of 0x71

Build a package
- `cd ~/catkin_ws`
- `catkin_make`

Source environment
- `source ~/.bashrc`
- `source ~/catkin/devel/setup.bash`

## JMOAB with ATCart Wheels

The board has an interface to send a command to control ATCart wheel system, it supports both regular 2-wheels or 4WD system. We need to have RC receiver which has SBUS functionality (Futaba as an example), and plug SBUS2 port from receiver to 4th row of J2 pin header. The board has failsafe function, if SBUS signal is lost, it will automatically switch itself to hold mode. We can change the mode by using ch5 on RC transmitter. Throttle is ch2 and steering is ch1, make sure to have correct direction control according to the transmitter's stick direction, otherwise just reverse the channel on your transmitter.


### Run

Run the jmoab-ros node
- `rosrun jmoab-ros jmoab-ros-atcart.py`, 

List out topics
- `rostopic list`, you would see there are two topics got generated `/sbus_rc_ch` for publishing SBUS RC channel, and `/sbus_cmd` for subscribing a steering and throttle commands from your autopilot code.

Check more detail on example scripts
- `rosrun jmoab-ros sbus_ch_listener.py` for test reading sbus channel on a script
- `rosrun jmoab-ros sbus_cmd_sender.py` for test writing a command steering and throttle from a script
